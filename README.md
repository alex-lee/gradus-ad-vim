# Gradus ad vim

> Note: this is very much a work in progress

For one who is new to vi/vim/neovim, it is hard to know where to start, and there are many resources
out there.

This is meant as a very quick roadmap of the most useful commands. I've tried to only include
commands that one will use on a daily basis, and the ordering is intended to get you moving as
quickly as possible. What is presented here is not comprehensive, but it should provide a pretty
good foundation.

To use these lists, just go in order. Practice each set of commands, trying to incorporate them as
much as possible in your daily editing. When you feel comfortable with them, move on to the next
set and repeat the process.

The explanations are short. To really understand what the commands do, just use them and see what
happens. For more details, refer to the vim/neovim documentation.
