## Indentation

```
>> <<

  [NV] Indent, dedent

C-t C-d

  [I] Indent, dedent (while in insert mode)
```

## Navigation

These are extremely useful as you jump around within a file or across files.

```
C-o

  [N] Jump to older position in jump list

C-i

  [N] Jump to newer position in jump list
```

For the jump list, `:help jumplist`.

## Basic searching

```
/{regex}

  [C] Begin a forward search.

?{regex}

  [C] Begin a backward search.

*

  [N] Begin a forward search of the word under the cursor.

n N

  [N] "next" Go to next match, go to previous match.
```

Try this: Begin a search. Use `n` to jump through some matches. Then use `C-o` and `C-i` to jump
backwards and forwards.

Some search settings:

```
:set hlsearch
:set nohlsearch

  [C] Highlight matches for the current search.
```

Some quirks of vim regular expressions:

```
\<foo\>

  Word boundaries

.\{-}

  Non-greedy quantifier
```
