# 04 gradus quartus

## Basic clipboard usage

```
yy

  [N] "yank" Copy the current line to the clipboard.

p

  [N] "paste (after)" Paste text after the cursor.

P

  [N] "paste (before)" Paste text before the cursor.
```

Copying with a motion (compare to `c_` and `d_` â€“ a pattern should be emerging).

```
yw      copy word
yiw     copy inner word
yaw     copy around word (subtly different from previous, try it out to see the difference)
Y       copy from cursor to end of line
```
