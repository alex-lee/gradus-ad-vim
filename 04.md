## Basic clipboard usage

```
yy

  [N] "yank" Copy the current line to the clipboard.

p

  [N] "paste (after)" Paste text after the cursor.

P

  [N] "paste (before)" Paste text before the cursor.
```

## Operators

When copying with `y`, you combine it with a motion.

```
y{motion}

  [N] "yank" Copy text covered by the motion to the clipboard.

  yw      copy word
  yiw     copy inner word
  yaw     copy around word (subtly different from previous, try it out to see the difference)
  Y       copy from cursor to end of line
```

Compare this to the `c_` and `d_` examples earlier. These are operator commands or
[operators](https://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/motion.html#operator).

These operators are combined with a motion. You can also precede them with a count.

```
10dd

  [N] Delete three lines of text (and copy to clipboard).

3cw

  [N] Change three words.
```
